## Introduction

AMWA IS-04/05 and the other NMOS Specifications were originally mostly used in ST 2110 RTP environments,  but have always been capable of extension to other streaming transports. BCP-007 is an extensible series of mappings specifying how to use NMOS for individual transports.

> BCP-007 is complemented by the BCP-006 series of _format_ mappings.

For details of the current set of mappings see the [list of BCPs](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos/#nmos-best-common-practices-bcp) on the main NMOS page.
