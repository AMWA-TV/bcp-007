This repository holds the source for this Specification, part of the family of [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos) from the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://amwa.tv)

<!-- INTRO-START -->

### What does the series do?

- The BCP-007 series of AMWA Best Common Practices define how to connect Endpoints using AMWA IS-04 and IS-05 for various transports including:
  - Specification of the resources and attributes used for the format.
  - Requirements for the Transport File (such as SDP).
  - Examples.

### Why does it matter?

- The individual mapping BCPs ensure consistency between implementations offering NMOS for each stream transport.
- Bringing these together in the BCP-007 series helps provide consistency between the individual mappings and provides an index of mappings.

### What are the mappings?

- See the [list of BCPs](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos/#nmos-best-common-practices-bcp) on the main NMOS page.
